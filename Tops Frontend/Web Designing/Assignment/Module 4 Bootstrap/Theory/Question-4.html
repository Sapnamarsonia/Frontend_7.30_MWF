1.) How does Bootstrap help in mobile-first design?
Bootstrap is designed with mobile-first principles, meaning styles are applied to small screens first, then scaled up.

2.) What are Bootstrap components? List and explain any three commonly used components.
Components are reusable UI elements. Examples:
Navbar: Navigation bar for menus and links.
Modal: A popup dialog window for alerts or forms.
Card: A flexible content container for images, text, buttons.

3.) What is the use of JavaScript plugins in Bootstrap? Name a few interactive components that require JS.
Bootstrapâ€™s JavaScript plugins add interactivity to components. They are built using vanilla JS (no jQuery in Bootstrap 5).

ex: 
Modal: For popup windows.
Collapse: For expanding/collapsing content.
Dropdown: Interactive menus.
