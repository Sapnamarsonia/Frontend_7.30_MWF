1.) What are the key components of Bootstrap? Name at least five with brief explanations.
Grid System: A responsive layout system using rows and columns.
Components: Pre-designed UI elements like buttons, navbars, cards, modals, etc.
Utilities: Helper classes for spacing, alignment, colors, etc.
Forms: Styled form elements like input fields, checkboxes, and validation.
JavaScript Plugins: Interactive elements like tooltips, carousels, dropdowns.


2.) Explain the Bootstrap Grid System. How does it work?
The Bootstrap grid system is based on a 12-column layout. You place content inside .container > .row > .col elements. Columns can be split into sizes (e.g., col-6 for half width), and they are responsive, adjusting based on screen size (col-sm-6, col-md-4, etc.).


3.) Differentiate between container, container-fluid, and container-xxl.

container: Fixed-width container that changes size at different breakpoints.
container-fluid: Full-width container that always spans 100% width.
container-xxl: Fixed-width container optimized for extra-large screens (â‰¥1400px).
