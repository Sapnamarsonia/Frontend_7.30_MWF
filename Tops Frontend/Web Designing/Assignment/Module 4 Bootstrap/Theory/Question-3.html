1.) What is the purpose of media queries in Bootstrap? How does Bootstrap handle responsiveness?
Media queries allow content to adapt to different screen sizes. 
Bootstrap uses predefined breakpoints (e.g., sm, md, lg) to apply different styles depending on device width, enabling mobile-first responsive design.


2.) Explain the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 (mention at least 3 differences).

jQuery Removed: Bootstrap 5 no longer depends on jQuery.
Improved Grid System: Introduced new xxl breakpoint and gutter control.
New Utility API: More control with utility classes (e.g., RTL support, custom utilities).
Dropped Internet Explorer support: Bootstrap 5 dropped support for IE10/11.

3.) What are utility classes in Bootstrap? Give examples of how they are used.

Utility classes are single-purpose helper classes that allow quick styling. Examples:
.mt-3 → margin-top: 1rem;
.text-center → centers text.
.bg-primary → blue background color.
.d-flex → applies flexbox layout.How does Bootstrap help in mobile-first design?
