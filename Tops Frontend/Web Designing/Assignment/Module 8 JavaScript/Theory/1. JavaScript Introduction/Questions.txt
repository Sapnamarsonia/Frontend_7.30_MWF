Question 1: What is JavaScript? Explain the role of JavaScript in web development.

javascript is a client side scripting langauge
it is used to make web pages interactive
it is a lightweight interpreted programming language
it is designed for creating network-centric applications

Role of JavaScript in Web Development:

Client-side scripting: JavaScript runs in the browser and interacts with HTML and CSS to control webpage behavior.
Dynamic Content: It can modify webpage content without reloading (e.g., dropdowns, modals, image sliders).
Form Validation: Checks user inputs before they’re submitted to the server.
Event Handling: Responds to user actions like clicks, keypresses, or mouse movements.
Communication: Works with APIs and sends/receives data (e.g., using fetch() or AJAX).
Used with frameworks/libraries: Like React, Angular, or Vue to build modern, responsive applications.

Question 2: How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python or Java? 

JavaScript:
C-like syntax; uses {} for blocks and ; to end statements.
It is event-driven and often runs in the browser.
Runs in the browser or Node.js (no compilation needed).
Mainly used for web development (frontend and backend using Node.js).

Python: Popular for data science, automation, AI, web development (backend).
Python is used more for data analysis, scripting, and automation.
Runs in an interpreter (scripted and executed line-by-line).
Focuses on readability; uses indentation to define code blocks.

Java: Used in enterprise applications, Android development, and large systems.
Java is used in large-scale applications like Android or banking software.
Verbose and strongly structured; requires more boilerplate code.
Compiled into bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Question 3: Discuss the use of <script> tag in HTML. How can you link an external JavaScript file to an HTML document?

Use of <script> Tag in HTML:
The <script> tag is used to embed or reference JavaScript code in an HTML document.
It can be placed in the <head> or before the closing </body> tag.

Linking external javascript:
To use external JavaScript, use the src attribute of the <script> tag.<script src="script.js"></script>
