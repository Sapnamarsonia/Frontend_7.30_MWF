Question 1: What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a 
function. 

A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help make code modular, organized, and easier to maintain. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can define it once inside a function and call it whenever needed.

Syntax for declaring a function:
function functionName(parameters) 
{
  // code to be executed
}

Syntax for calling (invoking) a function:
functionName(arguments);

=======================================================================
Question 2: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression? 

A function declaration defines a named function using the function keyword, while a function expression defines a function as part of an expression—often assigned to a variable.

1) Function Declaration
Defined with the function keyword followed by a name.
Hoisted, meaning it can be called before it is defined in the code.
Example :
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
sayHello();   // Works even if called before the declaration

2) Function Expression
The function is assigned to a variable (can be named or anonymous).
Not hoisted, meaning it can be called only after it is defined.
Example:
const sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi!");
};

sayHi();    //Works only after this line

=======================================================================
Question 3: Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.
Functions often need inputs to work with and can also produce outputs.
These are handled through parameters and return values.

1) Parameters
Parameters are variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
They act as placeholders for the values (called arguments) passed when the function is called.
Example :
function add(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}
add(5, 3);    // Output: 8
Here, a and b are parameters, and 5 and 3 are arguments.

2) Return Values

A function can send a value back to the place where it was called using the return statement.
Once return is executed, the function stops running.
Example:
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

let result = multiply(4, 5);
console.log(result); // Output: 20
Here, the function multiply returns the product of x and y, which is then stored in the variable result.
