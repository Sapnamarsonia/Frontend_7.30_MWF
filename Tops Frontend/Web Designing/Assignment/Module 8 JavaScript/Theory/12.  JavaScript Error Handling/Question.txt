Question 1: What is error handling in JavaScript? Explain the try, catch, and finally blocks with an example. 
Error handling in JavaScript refers to the process of detecting and responding to errors that occur during the 
execution of a program.
Errors might happen due to:
Invalid user input
Network issues
Undefined variables or functions
Incorrect data formats, etc.
JavaScript provides a mechanism called the try...catch...finally block to handle such errors gracefully without 
stopping the execution of the entire program.

=> Try, catch, and finally blocks with an example.
Syntax:  
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
} finally {
  // Code that will always run, regardless of whether there was an error
}

Example : 
try {
  let num = 10;
  console.log(num / x);     // 'x' is not defined — this will throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.log("An error occurred: " + error.message);
} finally {
  console.log("This will always run, regardless of an error.");
}

Question 2: Why is error handling important in JavaScript applications?

Error handling is crucial for building robust, user-friendly applications. Here’s why:

1. Prevents application crashes:
Without error handling, a single runtime error can stop script execution entirely.

2. Improves user experience:
Instead of displaying confusing technical errors, you can show user-friendly messages like
“Something went wrong. Please try again.”

3. Easier debugging and maintenance:
Properly caught errors can be logged, making it easier for developers to identify and fix problems.

4. Ensures program flow continues smoothly:
Error handling allows the program to recover or continue performing other operations even after an error occurs.

5. Helps handle asynchronous operations:
With features like try...catch in async/await, you can manage network or API errors cleanly.
