Question 1: What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, and const? 
JavaScript variables are the container for the data.
we can declare the variables in 3 ways.
using let, var, const keyword.

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called declaring a variable.
You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword , let keyword or the const keyword.
to declare the variable we can write 
1. var name = "Alia";
here variable name is declared using var keyword and value is asign using equal sign.  
2. let numnber = 25;
here variable number is declared using let keyword and value is asign using equal sign.  
3. const lastname = "kumar";
here variable lastname is declared using const keyword and value is asign using equal sign.

Question 2: Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for each. 
A JavaScript variable has 8 types of data.

String = A text of characters enclosed in quotes
ex:  let name = "demo1";

Number = A number representing a mathematical value
ex:  let height = "165";

Bigint	= A number representing a large integer
ex: let a = 123456789526585256n;

Boolean = A data type representing true or false
let x = true;

Object = A collection of key-value pairs of data
const person = {Firstname: "Kinjal", Lastname : "Patel"};

Undefined = A primitive variable with no assigned value
let x;

Null = A primitive value representing object absence
let x = null;

Symbol = A unique and primitive identifier
const y = Symbol();

Question 3: What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript?

undefined is automatically assigned by JavaScript, while null must be explicitly set by the developer.

undefined indicates a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, whereas null represents an intentional absence of value.

In loose equality (==), null and undefined are considered equal (true), but in strict equality (===), they are not (false).
