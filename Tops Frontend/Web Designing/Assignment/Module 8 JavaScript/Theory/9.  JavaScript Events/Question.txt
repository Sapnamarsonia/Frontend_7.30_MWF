Question 1: What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners. 
An event in JavaScript is an action or occurrence that happens in the browser, which the program can respond to.
Events are triggered by users or the browser itself.

Examples of events:
User actions: clicking a button, typing in a text box, moving the mouse, submitting a form.
Browser actions: page load, image load, error occurrence, resizing the window.

Example:
// Example event: user clicks a button
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
Here, the onclick event is triggered when the button is clicked.

Role of event listeners
An event listener is a function that waits (or "listens") for a specific event to happen on a specific element, and then executes a callback function in response.
Event listeners separate JavaScript code from HTML, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
You can attach multiple listeners to the same element.
They provide more control than using inline event attributes like onclick.

Question 2: How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an example.
The addEventListener() method allows you to listen for specific events on an element and run a function when that event occurs.

Example: element.addEventListener( event, function );
event = The name of the event (e.g., "click", "mouseover", "keydown")
function = The function to run when the event occurs (called the event handler)

Example : Basic Usage 

<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

<script>
  const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

  // Add an event listener for the "click" event
  button.addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button was clicked!");
  });
</script>


Example : Using named Function
<button id="greetBtn">Say Hello</button>

<script>
  const greetBtn = document.getElementById("greetBtn");

  function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }

  // Attach the event listener
  greetBtn.addEventListener("click", sayHello);
</script>
