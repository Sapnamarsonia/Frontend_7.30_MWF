Question 1: Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following 
elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead>. 

Answer: HTMl tables allow web developer to arrange data into rows and columns.
A table in html consist of table cells inside rows and columns.
1. <table> : it defines a table.It wrap all the content of the table.
Example: 
<table>
  <!--content -->
</table>

2.Table rows (<tr>): Each table rows starts with a <tr> and ends with </tr>.tr Representssingle row in the table.
we can have as many as row we want.
Example:
<tr>
  <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
  <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
</tr>

3.Table Headers (<th>): sometimes we have we want our cells to be table header cells in that case we use <th> and </th>
instaed of <td>.
in <th> tag elemets are bold and centered by default but we can change using css.
Example: 
<tr>
  <th>Name</th>
  <th>Age</th>
</tr>

4.Table Cell (<td>) : Each table cell is defined by a <td> and </td> tag.Everything between <td> and </td> is the content of a table cell.
Example:
<tr>
  <td>demo</td>
  <td>30</td>
</tr>

5.Table head (<thead>) : This group the header content in a table.
It orgamize the structure systematically.
Example:

  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>

Question 2: What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide examples.
Answer: In html colspan and rowspan are the attribute used in <td> or <tr> elemnts to merge the coloumn or row resp.
1. colspan merge two column.
ex: <tr>
    <th colspan="2">name</th>
    <th>age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Rohit</td>
    <td>Sharma</td>
    <td>40<?td>

    so here , name will appear as Rohit sharma together.

    2. rowspan merges multiple rows together in a single cell.
    <tr>
    <th rowspan="2" > name</th>
    <th>age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>30</td>
    </tr>

so now here two rows of diffrent age willl merge and appear as single.

Question 3: Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better alternative?
Answer: Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because they were not designed for layout â€” they are meant for displaying tabular data. Using tables for layout introduces several issues:
1. Poor Assessibility : Reader will missinterpret the data while reading specially for visually imaparied person.
2.Inflexible code:there are lots of diffrent atgs are used in the html table which makes it clutter white coding and result will not be proper.
3.Not responsive: while using diffrent screens it doesnot make it responsive unless used too much css.

better alternative for this is to use Flexbox or Grid with css.
