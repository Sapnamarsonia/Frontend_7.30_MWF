What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms 
flex-container and flex-item. 

CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model designed to arrange elements efficiently in a one-dimensional space â€” either horizontally (row) or vertically (column). It makes it easier to design flexible, responsive layouts without using floats or complex positioning.

Why Flexbox is Useful
Aligns items horizontally or vertically with ease
Distributes space between items dynamically
Helps elements resize and adapt to different screen sizes
Simplifies common layout tasks like centering, spacing, and ordering

flex-container
This is the parent element that defines a flex context for its children.

flex-item
These are the direct children of a flex container. Their layout behavior is controlled by the container and their own flex properties.

Basic Flexbox Properties
display: flex; = Enables flexbox layout
flex-direction	= Row (default), column, row-reverse, column-reverse
justify-content	 = Aligns items horizontally (main axis)
align-items	= Aligns items vertically (cross axis)
flex-wrap = Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines

On the flex items:
flex  = Shorthand for grow, shrink, and basis
flex-grow = How much the item should grow
flex-shrink	 = How much the item should shrink
flex-basis = Initial size of the item
align-self	= Overrides align-items for one item
order	= Controls the order of items
