What is the difference between border-box and content-box box-sizing in 
CSS? Which is the default?

The box-sizing property in CSS determines how the total width and height of an element are calculated â€” specifically, whether padding and border are included in the width/height or added outside it.

Content-box
============
only content is included in the width and height.
padding and border are added outside of the dimension.
css
box-sizing: content-box;
example:
width: 200px;
padding: 10px;
border: 5px solid;

Actual width= 200(content)+20(padding)+10(border)=230px

Border-box
==========
The content, padding, and border are all included in the specified width and height.
This makes layouts more predictable, especially in responsive design.
css
box-sizing: border-box;
example:
width: 200px;
padding: 10px;
border: 5px solid;

Content width = 200 - 20 (padding) - 10 (border) = 170px
