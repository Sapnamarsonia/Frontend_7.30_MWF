Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, 
margin). How does each affect the size of an element? 

The CSS box model is a foundational concept in web design and layout. It describes how elements on a webpage are structured and how their dimensions are calculated. Every HTML element is considered as a rectangular box, and the box model defines the space an element occupies, including its content, padding, border, and margin.

Components of the Box Model:
Content
=======
This is the innermost part of the box where text and images appear.
The width and height you set for an element (e.g., width: 200px) apply only to the content by default.
It determines the actual size of the element's visible content.

Padding
=======
Padding is the space between the content and the border.
It adds space inside the box, expanding the box outward but still within the element.
Increases the visual size of the element without affecting margins.
Example: padding: 10px adds 10 pixels of space inside the border on all sides.

Border
======
The border wraps around the padding and content.
It has a thickness, style (solid, dashed, etc.), and color.
Border size adds directly to the overall dimensions of the element.
Example: border: 2px solid black adds 2 pixels to each side.

Margin
======
Margin is the outermost space between the elementâ€™s border and surrounding elements.
It creates space between this element and others.
Margins are transparent and do not contain content.
Example: margin: 20px creates 20 pixels of spacing around the entire element.
