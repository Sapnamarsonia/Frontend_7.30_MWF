What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the 
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

External CSS
============
CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML using a <link> tag in the <head>.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

Advantages:
Separation of concerns: Keeps HTML and CSS separate, improving readability and maintainability.
Reusable: One CSS file can style multiple pages, reducing redundancy.
Better caching: The browser can cache the CSS file, improving load times on subsequent visits.

Disadvantages:
Requires an additional HTTP request to load the CSS file (though this is often negligible and cacheable).
May cause a brief flash of unstyled content (FOUC) if the CSS loads slowly.

Internal CSS
============
CSS is written within a <style> tag inside the <head> of the HTML document.

<head>
  <style>
    body { background-color: lightblue; }
  </style>
</head>

Advantages:
Useful for single-page websites or testing small changes quickly.
No extra HTTP request (since it's part of the HTML file).

Disadvantages:
Not reusable across multiple pages.
Makes the HTML file longer and less organized.
Less efficient for larger sites.

Inline CSS
==========
CSS is applied directly to an element using the style attribute.

Advantages:
Fastest to implement for a single style change or testing.
Overrides internal and external styles due to higher specificity.

Disadvantages:
Terrible for maintainabilityâ€”styles are scattered and hard to manage.
Bloats HTML and violates separation of concerns.
Not reusable, and overrides can cause conflicts.
