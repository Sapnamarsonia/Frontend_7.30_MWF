Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple styles 
get resolved? 

CSS Specificity is a system used by browsers to determine which CSS rule applies when multiple rules could apply to the same element. Itâ€™s essentially a ranking system that resolves conflicts between competing styles.

Every CSS selector has a position in the specificity hierarchy.

Priority	                 |    Example	              |      Description
Inline style	             | <h1 style="color: pink;">  |	    Highest priority, directly applied with the style attribute
Id selectors	             | #navbar	                  |     Second highest priority, identified by the unique id attribute of an element
Classes and pseudo-classes	 | .test, :hover	          |     Third highest priority, targeted using class names
Attributes	                 | [type="text"]	          |     Low priority, applies to attributes
Elements and pseudo-elements | h1, ::before, ::after	  |     Lowest priority, applies to HTML elements and pseudo-elements


More Specificity Rules:
=======================
1.Equal specificity: the latest rule wins
2.ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors
3.A class selector beats any number of element selectors - a class selector such as .intro beats h1, p, div, etc.
4.The universal selector (*) and inherited values - The universal selector (*) and inherited values do not impact the specificity weight value


Conflict Resolution Rules:
==========================
Higher specificity wins.
If specificity is equal, the later rule in the CSS file wins (source order).
!important can override specificity (but should be avoided unless necessary).
