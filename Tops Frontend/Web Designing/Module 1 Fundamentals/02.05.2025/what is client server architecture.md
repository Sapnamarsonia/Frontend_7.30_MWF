What is Client Server Architechture?
Here we have two words 
client- a device or program that requests service or resources.
server- a device or program that provides services or resources.

How it works?
1. Client sends request to the server.
2. The server processess the request and sends back the appropriate response.
3. Communication typically happens over a network.

Ex: Web broswer - google.com is a server and our browser is a client.
