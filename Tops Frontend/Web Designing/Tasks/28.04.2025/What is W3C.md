What is W3C?
W3C stands for the World Wide Web Consortium. It's an international community that develops open 
standards to ensure the long-term growth and accessibility of the web. The W3C was founded in 1994 
by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.
The goal of W3C is to standardize and improve the web by developing protocols and guidelines that help 
maintain interoperability between different web technologies, ensuring that websites and applications 
are accessible, usable, and work consistently across different devices and platforms.

Characteristics of W3C
It is responsible for creating and publishing web standards.
It also ensures the growth and development of web.
It also develops the standards for web scripting, web applications and other dynamic contents.
It is an organization which helps in the promotion of interoperability by the promotion and designing of open protocols.
W3C uses the principles of modularity, simplicity and extensibility while designing web protocols.

Advantages
W3C enables the easier maintenance of the W3C validated websites.
It provides a consistent and defined look for all the W3C validated websites.
It standardizes the validated websites so that they are accessible to different devices.
It enables faster browser interaction.

Disadvantages
W3C validation is a timely process and thus the time for full validation depends on the website code.
W3C validation exercises have costs associated with them.
Sometimes translation issues arise in W3C validation of websites.
